1.	Riverview Kitchen
Open from 9:30am to 5pm. Personally I feel it offers the best pancakes, brunch and lunch in town.  Get your timings right so that you are not queueing, but with a great view of the river, this has quickly become a quintessentially Durham hotspot.

2.	La spaghettata (Spags)

A classic Durham student choice, its cheap and cheerful and the litre bottles of wine are much appreciated. We may have heard of a couple of food poisoning incidents occurring from there but as we are yet to fall ill ourselves, it’s coming in at number two.

3.	Flat White
A staple and well known beyond even Durham, this place has ridiculous queues, sometimes ridiculous prices and VERY small toilets but the food is pretty amazing – once again especially the pancakes but also the cakes.

4.	Leonard’s
Cute, reasonably priced and often said to be a better Flat White if only the hot drinks were slightly better.

5.	Nadon Thai
Good food, once more reasonably priced and with super friendly staff.  It’s great Thai food that you can even get on Deliveroo

6.	Treats
Amazing gluten-free options, once more reasonably priced and very good location in the centre of town

7.	Zen
Bit overpriced and a bit overrated but still … pretty good Thai food
8.	Cafédral
Amazing scones, so close to the Cathedral and great paninis – but definitely not enough seating.

9.	Paddy’s
Nothing really that special food wise but an absolute classic in Durham that actually cannot be beaten on a night out
10.	 Chapters
Why they only take cash is beyond me but their sandwiches are great, the service is great and the atmosphere is always spot on – it is always busy here too
