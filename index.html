          <ol>
         	<li><strong>Riverview Kitchen</strong> <br>
          Open from 9:30am to 5pm. Personally I feel it offers the best pancakes, brunch and lunch in town.  Get your timings right so that you are not queueing, but with a great view of the river, this has quickly become a quintessentially Durham hotspot.
          <li>Spag's <br>
          A classic Durham student choice, its cheap and cheerful and the litre bottles of wine are much appreciated. We may have heard of a couple of food poisoning incidents occurring from there but as we are yet to fall ill ourselves, it’s coming in at number two. </P>

          <li>Flat White <br>
          A staple and well known beyond even Durham, this place has ridiculous queues, sometimes ridiculous prices and VERY small toilets but the food is pretty amazing – once again especially the pancakes but also the cakes.

          <li>Leonard’s <br>
          Cute, reasonably priced and often said to be a better Flat White if only the hot drinks were slightly better.

          <li>Nadon Thai <br>
          Good food, once more reasonably priced and with super friendly staff.  It’s great Thai food that you can even get on Deliveroo.

          <li>Treats <br>
          Amazing gluten-free options, once more reasonably priced and very good location in the centre of town.

          <li>Zen<br>
          Bit overpriced and a bit overrated but still … pretty good Thai food.

          <li>Cafédral<br>
          Amazing scones, so close to the Cathedral and great paninis – but definitely not enough seating.

          <li>Paddy’s<br>
          Nothing really that special food wise but an absolute classic in Durham that actually cannot be beaten on a night out.

          <li>Chapters<br>
          Why they only take cash is beyond me but their sandwiches are great, the service is great and the atmosphere is always spot on – it is always busy here too.
