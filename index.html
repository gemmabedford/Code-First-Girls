    <p>Welcome to our website! During our time as students in Durham, we've experienced loads of different things. Maybe
      you'd like to try our <a href="#topic1">Top Ten Independent Eateries</a> or you could be brushing up on our
      <a href="#topic2">Top Ten Attractions</a> or <a href="#topic3">Best Hotels</a> for when your parents come over.
      Whatever it is, we've got you covered.</p>

          <ol>
         	<li><strong>Riverview Kitchen</strong><br>
          Open from 9:30am to 5pm. Personally I feel it offers the best pancakes, brunch and lunch in town.  Get your timings right so that you are not queueing, but with a great view of the river, this has quickly become a quintessentially Durham hotspot.
          <li><strong>Spag's</strong><br>
          A classic Durham student choice, its cheap and cheerful and the litre bottles of wine are much appreciated. We may have heard of a couple of food poisoning incidents occurring from there but as we are yet to fall ill ourselves, it’s coming in at number two. </P>
          <li><strong>Flat White</strong><br>
          A staple and well known beyond even Durham, this place has ridiculous queues, sometimes ridiculous prices and VERY small toilets but the food is pretty amazing – once again especially the pancakes but also the cakes.
          <li><strong>Leonard’s </strong><br>
          Cute, reasonably priced and often said to be a better Flat White if only the hot drinks were slightly better.
          <li><strong>Nadon Thai</strong> <br>
          Good food, once more reasonably priced and with super friendly staff.  It’s great Thai food that you can even get on Deliveroo.
          <li><strong>Treats</strong> <br>
          Amazing gluten-free options, once more reasonably priced and very good location in the centre of town.
          <li><strong>Zen</strong><br>
          Bit overpriced and a bit overrated but still … pretty good Thai food.
          <li><strong>Cafédral</strong><br>
          Amazing scones, so close to the Cathedral and great paninis – but definitely not enough seating.
          <li><strong>Paddy’s</strong><br>
          Nothing really that special food wise but an absolute classic in Durham that actually cannot be beaten on a night out.
          <li><strong>Chapters</strong><br>
          Why they only take cash is beyond me but their sandwiches are great, the service is great and the atmosphere is always spot on – it is always busy here too.

              Nothing like potentially falling into the river to get your spirits up.

              One of the biggest inland waters in England!

              A modern, comfortable theatre staging comedy, music and drama.
            <li><strong>Seaham Beach</strong><br>
              One of the best beaches in the world for collecting sea glass.

            Battlemented towers, thick walls, inner courtyard - this place drips with atmosphere.

            Small and intimate with a boudoir sense of style.
